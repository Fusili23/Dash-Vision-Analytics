# Dash Vision Analytics

Advanced trajectory prediction system for dashcam footage using YOLOv11 and ByteTrack.

Real-time trajectory prediction for vehicles and pedestrians in dashcam videos. 
It compensates for ego-vehicle motion using optical flow and incorporates environmental context like traffic lights and road boundaries to generate more accurate predictions.

P.S at least that's what I wanted to do

## Methods and Models

**Object Detection and Tracking**
- YOLOv11 (nano variant) for real-time object detection
- ByteTrack for multi-object tracking across frames


## Documentation
